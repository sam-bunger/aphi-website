              The Iota Iota chapter of Alpha Phi was colonized in 2002 at the George
              Washington University in the beautiful city of Washington D.C. We are
              consisted of women from different countries around the world, diverse
              passions and interests, and wanting to make a difference on our campus
              and in the D.C community. You will find the most empowered, empathetic,
              passionate, amiable women in our chapter. We support one another like
              all sisters should. Our dedication to raising money for our philanthropy
               the Alpha Phi Foundation brings our sisters even closer together.

                old all around the world. From hand to hand and heart to heart, we are
               all grateful and proud of the legacy left to us by our Founders.

                in lifelong achievement. We accomplish this mission through the

              The commitment of our founders to foster a "spirit of love and charity"
              has stood the test of time and remains as important to Alpha Phi
              today as it was in 1872. Practicing generosity and seeking to
              improve the lives of women are basic tenants of our Fraternity.

      <h4>
        One of the most important and honorable aspects to being a member of
        Alpha Phi is having the opportunity to give back to the community. We as
         sisters, are motivated to create change around the world, and we do
         this by being involved in philanthropic efforts.

      <h3>National Philanthropy</h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        What makes Alpha Phi International Fraternity unique is we have our own
        philanthropic organization, named the Alpha Phi Foundation. In 1956,
        Alpha Phi was one of the first women’s fraternities to establish a
        Foundation as a trust to award grants specifically for scholarship and
        women’s heart health. We hold an annual Red Dress Gala with our sisters,
        family, alumnae and friends to help raise money and awareness for
        women’s heart health. This past year during Iota Iota’s 12th Annual Red
        Dress Gala, we raised over a total of $13,500 to help fund research and
        treatment for women’s heart health.
