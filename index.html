      <h2>Letter from our President</h2>
      <hr/>
      <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        Welcome to the Iota Iota Chapter of Alpha Phi at George Washington University. Thank you for visiting our page!
      </p>
      <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
          My name is Anita Clifford, and I am currently a sophomore at GW. Located in the beautiful city of Washington 
          D.C., the Iota Iota chapter is consisted of around 150 strong-willed, intelligent, and diverse women that 
          create change both in and outside of our chapter. I was inspired to run for Chapter President by all the 
          amazing women in our chapter. On bid day, I gained more than a sorority. I gained friendships that would 
          last a lifetime, and a home away from home. My college experience was changed the day I accepted my bid, 
          as I am now surrounded by sisters that push me to be better version of myself. 
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                The women of Iota Iota are extremely involved in philanthropy and organizations, both through our national 
                philanthropy and outside organizations. We take pride in the Alpha Phi Foundation and love planning events 
                such as the Red Dress Gala, and Heart Week to raise awareness and money for women’s heart health. Our women 
                are also involved in many other student organizations such as GW Women In Business, One Tent Health, 
                GlobeMed, GW Fashion Business Association, Model UN and GW TV.  Our sisters also work hard outside of 
                academics, and intern at places such as their home country embassies, the White House, the United States 
                Capital, law firms and NBC Universal. The women of this chapter are the foundation to our success and all 
                we achieve here at GW!
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Walking into our Alpha Phi townhouse everyday and seeing all of my best friends makes my day! I have 
                created friendships and memories that will last a lifetime. Here at Alpha Phi, I have extensively 
                given back to the GW and DC community, excelled in academics and now can proudly say I have became a 
                leader in the Greek community, and couldn’t have done it without my sisters. I know that my sisters, 
                the house, and the bonds that I have formed will be with me through thick and thin for the next couple 
                years of college. I am so humbled to lead a fantastic group of women at Iota Iota and will uphold the 
                values our founders created in 1872. Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions!

              passionate, amiable women in our chapter. We support one another like

        One of the most important and honorable aspects to being a member of
        Alpha Phi is having the opportunity to give back to the community. We as
         sisters, are motivated to create change around the world, and we do

      <p>
        &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        What makes Alpha Phi International Fraternity unique is we have our own
        philanthropic organization, named the Alpha Phi Foundation. In 1956,
        Alpha Phi was one of the first women’s fraternities to establish a
        Foundation as a trust to award grants specifically for scholarship and
        women’s heart health. We hold an annual Red Dress Gala with our sisters,
        family, alumnae and friends to help raise money and awareness for
        women’s heart health. This past year during Iota Iota’s 12th Annual Red
        Dress Gala, we raised over a total of $13,500 to help fund research and
        treatment for women’s heart health.

                We like to think of fun and creative ways our GW Community can get involved in helping 
                us raise money for the Alpha Phi Foundation. Every fall semester we hold Alpha Phifa where 
                fraternities, sports teams, and different organizations at GW play against each other in a 
                soccer competition to see who can win the title of Alpha Phifa Champions. Ever Spring 
                semester we put on Heart Week, which every day we have a different event to help raise 
                money for the Alpha Phi Foundation. For an entire week, the GW community participates in 
                events with the sisters of Alpha Phi including, Mac & Phis, Queen of Hearts, and Eat Your 
                Hearts Out. We look forward to this week every year!

      <h3>Big Sister/Little Sister</h3>
      <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
          One of the best parts about joining Alpha Phi is gaining a new big sister! Each new member receives a big sister 
          during their first semester who will serve as your role model and best friend. Big sisters help guide the younger 
          women throughout their Alpha Phi journey here at Iota Iota, whether it is giving great advice, going out to dinner 
          together, helping with academics, and anything else! Those Big Sisters will be there for you no matter what! During 
          the new member’s second year, they will also receive a little! Since this tradition has continued since the colonization 
          of Iota Iota, there are long family lineages and all of those women are there to guide you too!

      <h3>Sisterhood Events</h3>
      <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
          Sisterhood events create the best memories for the women of Iota Iota! Our bigger events involve sisterhood retreat, 
          crush parties, formal and semi-formal dances! Our smaller events include pizza night, study hours, dinner hours in 
          the Alpha Phi Townhouse, and mixers between each pledge classes. 
      </p>
      <p>
          &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   
          We get our sweat on at sisterhood workout classes 
          at CorePower Yoga, SoulCycle, Orange Theory and Blast! Different clothing companies like Wylie Grey hold trunk shows 
          for the whole chapter. At the end of the school year, we hold Senior Sendoff, a week full of fun filled events to 
          give our seniors the best last hoorah. These events strengthen our sisterhood, as we bond over our similar interests 
          and hobbies!
